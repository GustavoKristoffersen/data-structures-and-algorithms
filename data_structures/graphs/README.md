# :bookmark_tabs: Graph

A `Graph` is a data structure useful for building relationships between data and simulate real world connections.

All trees are graphs but not all graphs are trees. In fact, trees are a type of graph used to represent hierarchies. In graphs, a node is usually called `vertex` while the connection lines between them are called `edges`.

Graphs can have many different patterns that are not common to trees such as `cycles`, `unconnected vertices`. `self-loops` and `parallel edges`.

### Cycles

A `cycle` appears in graphs when vertices are connected to each other in a way that we can travel to each of them and we eventually get to the starting vertex.

### Unconnected vertices

Graph vertices do not necessarily need to be connected to anything. Vertices that do not have any connection i.e. edge, are called `unconnected vertices`.

### Self-loops

A graph vertex can also be connected to itself, indicating a self relation. Edges that connect a vertex to itself are called `self-loops`.

### Parallel edges

A graph vertex is also not limited to only one connection with another vertex. A graph vertex can have multiple connections with a single vertex. Multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices are called `parallel edges`.

### Directed and Undirected Graphs

A `directed graph` (digraph) is a graph where the edges have a specific direction associated with them, indicating one-way relationships between vertices. This means that a connection from vertex A to vertex B does not imply a connection from B to A.

In contrast, an `undirected graph` has bidirectional edges without any specific direction. In `undirected graphs`, if there is an edge between vertices A and B, it indicates a symmetric relationship where traversal is possible in both directions.

### Weighted Graphs

A `weighted graph` implies that edges have weights associated with them indicating measures related to the context. For example, in a transportation network, the weights might represent distances between locations.

## :bookmark_tabs: Search - O(V + E)

The efficiency of a graph search is O(V + E) being E the number of vertices and E the number of edges. This is because for each vertex we also have to iterate over its adjacent vertices, even though we might ignore the ones that weâ€™ve already visited we still need to get there to confirm that we have visited. In reality, we visit the same edge more than once on a graph search, so the most correct approximation would probably be something like O(V + 2E), but since we drop constants in Big O notation, it gets simplified to just O(V + E).

It's important to note that there's essentially 2 ways for traversing/search on graph-like data structures, which are `Breadth First Search`and `Depth First Search`. You can learn more about each of them in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk).
