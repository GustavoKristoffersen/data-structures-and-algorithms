# :bookmark_tabs: About this repository

This repository was made as i was in the process of studying Data Structure and Algorithms. The contents available here can be useful for you if you are also studying the subject or in case you just need to consult something in specific or check some implementations.

This repo currently has all the main implementations of the most known data strucures and algorithms in Python and JavaScript, which are the languages i'm most familiar with.

Each folder contains the implementation of the data structure/algorithm and also a readme that contains an explanation of the core concepts of it as well as links to additional resources.

The contents here were based in 3 main sources, which are the following:

1 - [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/GustavoKristoffersen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/extras/docs/A%20Common-Sense%20Guide%20to%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms_%20Level%20Up%20Your%20Core%20Programming%20Skills) - Book by Jay Wengrow

2 - [This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/estrutura-de-dados-e-algoritmos-python-guia-completo) - Udemy course

3 - [This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms) - Udemy course

4 - Other additional resources that i link in the explanation readmes of each implementation.
